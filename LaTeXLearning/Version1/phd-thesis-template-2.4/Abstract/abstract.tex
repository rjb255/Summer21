Experimentation is a tedious and expensive process with many experimentations discarded as failures. Too often, the experimenter is focused too heavily on a local minima that they beieve holds all their answers. This narrowmindness leads to the loss of the global minima: a far more fullfilling find. By using active learning, this paper aims to show that the global minima can be found with limited loss of resources and time. By using smoothing splines, the experimentor might not even test at the minimum in order to be confident on its location.

This paper focuses primarily on problems with 1 parameter. In doing so, it shows how for a noisy expensive function, the global minima can be found with fewer function calls than fminbound \cite{2020SciPy-NMeth} and to a higher degree of certainty. Further work is encouraged within this area, particularly with the generalisation to n-dimential problems.
